## Data processing modules:
Look for an example of usage in AERO_box/main.py  
## Timeseries module manual:  
There are 2 versions of the Timeseries prediction module, 1 is LSTM, 1 is Hybrid
Step 1: your environment should installed pytorch and cudatoolkit that suitable for your pytorch in case you want to train by GPU    
Step 2: in terminal, run pip install -r requirements.txt   
Step 3: Open the timeseries_hybrid.ipynb from AERO_box folder perspective, otherwise you need to change some path so that the notebook could run normally   
Step 4: Run all and wait for the solution  

Do the same thing to timeseries_with lstm.ipynb to compare!
